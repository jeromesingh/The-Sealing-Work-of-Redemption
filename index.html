  <p class="bible">2 Timothy 2:19-22 KJV  Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that
  are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.  (20)  But in a great house there are
  not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.  (21) 
  If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's
  use, and prepared unto every good work.  (22)  Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity,
  peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

  </p>

  <p class="bible">2 Corinthians 1:19-22 KJV  For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus
  and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.  (20)  For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him
  Amen, unto the glory of God by us.  (21)  Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God;
   (22)  Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
</p>

  <p class="bible">Luke 21:27-28 KJV  And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.  (28)  And when
  these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.

</p>

  <p class="bible" >Ephesians 1:3-7 KJV  Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual
  blessings in heavenly places in Christ:  (4)  According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world,
  that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:  (5)  Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children
  by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,  (6)  To the praise of the glory of his grace,
  wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.  (7)  In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of
  sins, according to the riches of his grace;

</p>

<p class="bible">Ephesians 1:11-14 KJV  In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him
who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:  (12)  That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first
trusted in Christ.  (13)  In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation:
in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,  (14)  Which is the earnest of our
inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.

</p>

<p class="bible">2 Peter 1:3-4 KJV  According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness,
through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:  (4)  Whereby are given unto us exceeding great
and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is
in the world through lust.

  </p>

<p class="bible" >2 Peter 2:20-22 KJV  For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the
beginning.  (21)  For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have
known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.  (22)  But it is happened unto them according to the
true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.


<p class="bible">Romans 4:11 KJV  And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet
being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that
righteousness might be imputed unto them also:

</p>

<p class="bible">Philippians 3:3-11 KJV  For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and
have no confidence in the flesh.  (4)  Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that
he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:  (5)  Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the
tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;  (6)  Concerning zeal, persecuting the
church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.  (7)  But what things were gain to me, those I
counted loss for Christ.  (8)  Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of
Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win
Christ,  (9)  And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the
faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:  (10)  That I may know him, and the power of his
resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;  (11)  If by any means I
might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.


</p>

<p class="bible">Romans 2:25-29 KJV  For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy
circumcision is made uncircumcision.  (26)  Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not
his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?  (27)  And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the
law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?  (28)  For he is not a Jew, which is one
outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:  (29)  But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly;
and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.

</p>

<p class="bible">Romans 6:16-17 KJV  Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey;
whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?  (17)  But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of
sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.

</p>

<p class="bible">Romans 8:14-17 KJV  For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.  (15)  For ye have not
received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
 (16)  The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:  (17)  And if children, then
heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified
together.

</p>

<p class="bible">Ephesians 4:25-30 KJV  Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of
another.  (26)  Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:  (27)  Neither give place to the
devil.  (28)  Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is
good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.  (29)  Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but
that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.  (30)  And grieve not the holy
Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.

</p>

<p class="bible">Isaiah 8:16 KJV  Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.

</p>

<p class="bible">Romans 7:9-14 KJV  For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.  (10) 
And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.  (11)  For sin, taking occasion by the
commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.  (12)  Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and
good.  (13)  Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working
death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.  (14)  For we know that
the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.

</p>

<p class="bible">Romans 8:1-4 KJV  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the
flesh, but after the Spirit.  (2)  For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of
sin and death.  (3)  For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in
the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:  (4)  That the righteousness of the law might be
fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

</p>

<p class="bible">1 John 3:4-10 KJV  Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.  (5) 
And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.  (6)  Whosoever abideth in him sinneth
not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.  (7)  Little children, let no man deceive you: he that
doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.  (8)  He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil
sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the
devil.  (9)  Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he
is born of God.  (10)  In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not
righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.
